# Diabetes-Risk-Analysis-Deep-Learning
A deep learning project that predicts diabetes risk based on physical symptoms and lifestyle data, featuring comprehensive data visualization and comparative model analysis.
# Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using early-stage symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, sudden weight loss, and others. The analysis focuses on lifestyle data and physical signs rather than just laboratory results.

## Key Features
- **Symptom-Based Analysis:** Focuses on 10+ clinical symptoms including "Delayed Healing" and "Obesity".
- **Advanced Visualization:** Utilizes Boxen Plots and Heatmaps to analyze the correlation between age, gender, and risk factors.
- **Machine Learning:** Implements classification algorithms to provide high-accuracy risk assessment.

## Project Structure
- `Diyabet_Analizi.ipynb`: Full Python source code including data preprocessing and modeling.
- `diabetes_data.csv`: Dataset containing patient records and medical features.
- `Diyabet_Riski_Analizi.pdf`: Comprehensive project report detailing the methodology and findings.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
